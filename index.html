                <h3>Sound</h3>
                <p>The sound of the 64 Audio U4S is one of pure fun and musicality, you will definetely get immersed in the music the moment you start listening to them, it is not the type of earphone that will let you discover new and undiscovered details in your favorite songs, but will let you experience them in a slightly warm, yet powerful manner making you feel wrapped by the voices (specially the voices) and instruments.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph">
                <h3>Bass</h3>
                <p>In more than one way, this might be the strongest point of the U4S, firstly because the bass slam might be the first thing you notice when listening them for the first time, powerful, with a slight warm to it and well bodied, making some drum and bass notes incredibly delightful, and of course, when talking about heavy bass music, depending of wich apex module you are using the U4S with, you will feel such a creamy yet powerful bass hit you with all it's might. And thanks to the apex modules implementation, you can module the level of bass you want to have, making the U4S bass incredibly flexible.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph">
                <h3>Mids</h3>
                <p>Ok, ok, maybe not every part of the sound of the U4S can be perfect, I can say for sure that the mid range is U4S weakest point, it might note have the detail and instrument separation of other earphones for this price range but it is most definetely not bad, you can still listen to the many layers if the instruments and voices present in any song, the texture of both is decent but not great, depending of wich apex module you are using the mids might have a slight recession or a full V shape sound with more recessed mids.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="paragraph">
                <h3>Highs</h3>
                <p>Honestly I wasn't expecting the quality of sound of the highs when having my first impressions, thanks to the balance armature drivers taking care of the highs, they have such a nice airy sense to them, and also quite a nice extension and sense of detail to them, I have to say, sometimes that sense of detail becomes a little bit too much giving the music a slight "metallic" tone to it, not completely natural unlike lets say... a dynamic driver might do, but the airy sensation and the extension and detail are more that you could expect of a dynamic driver, so I guess it balances out in the end.</p>

            <div id="paragraph">
                <h3>Technicalities</h3>
                <p>Another good point to the U4S it's the great sense of space they showcase, the width of the soundsatge is quite big, honestly I have such a hard time really "feeling" a good and open soundstage with in ear monitors like this one, unlike over-ear headphones that actually sound HUGE in comparison, but still the U4S soundstage it's quite nice and enveloping for an earphone. the imaging is quite nice and I enjoy gaming with them a lot, I have some other high end earphones that fail the gaming test or at least aren't as precise with positioning as the U4S so I can say that imaging is one os the U4S strongest points.</p>

            <div id="paragraph">
                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>There is a good reason the U4S are my favorite earphones, they are completely fun and musical, powerful and creamy bass and also maintaining that nice sense of detail and airiness, even some friends that have quite the earphones, and some so much pricier than the U4S even liked the U4S more than their earphones and that says quite a lot of them, if you are interested in adquiring the 64 Auido U4S, you can<a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.64audio.com/products/u4s" target="_blank" > get the U4S in 64Audio site</a>.</p>
